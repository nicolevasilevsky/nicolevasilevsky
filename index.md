excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am the Associate Director of Data Science at the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/), which maximizes the value of rare disease patient-level data through curation, standardization and sharing of data; integration across data sources and types; and creation of
drug development tools. My goal is to leverage my expertise in ontology development, data standards and annotation application to lead a team of data scientists to develop and implement a data curation pipeline utilizing the organizationâ€™s knowledge graph and proof-of-concept rare disease application ontology (CPONT). I am a curator for the [Mondo Disease Ontology](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/), a semantic standard for disease classifications and definitions. Additionally, I am active in educational efforts in data management best practices and data science, including the [OBO Academy](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/).

## Projects:

- [Critical Path Institute Rare Diseases Cure Accelerator-Data Analysis Platform (RDCA-DAP)](https://c-path.org/programs/rdca-dap/)

### Ontology development
- [Monarch Disease Ontology (Mondo)](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/)
- [Critical Path Application Ontology (CPONT)](https://gitlab.c-path.org/c-pathontology/critical-path-ontology)
- [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/)
- [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology)
- [Phenotype and Trait Ontology](https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato)
- [Environmental Exposure Ontology](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology)
- [Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno)](https://github.com/obophenotype/upheno)
- [Contributor Role Ontology](https://data2health.github.io/contributor-role-ontology/)

### Educational Materials

- [Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/): a data resource portal containing data about pediatric cancers and structural abnormalities
- [CRAFT corpus](http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT/): The Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text Corpus (CRAFT) is a manually annotated corpus consisting of 67 full-text biomedical journal articles.
- [Center for Cancer Data Harmonization](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/center-cancer-data-harmonization-ccdh): The CCDH will work with the National Cancer Institute Cancer Research Data Commons to make cancer research data more useful and accessible.
