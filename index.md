excerpt: "About Me..."

My research focuses on development and use of semantic technologies to facilitate new knowledge discovery and promote scientific reproducibility. My expertise is in biocuration, and the development of biomedical ontologies and data standards for phenotypes, diseases and other biomedical domains with the goal of improving disease diagnostics and health outcomes. Additionally, I am active in educational efforts in data management best practices and data science.

## Current Interests and Projects:

### Biocuration projects
- [Monarch Inititative](https://monarchinitiative.org/): a system that allows for cross-species disease discovery
- [Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/): a data resource portal containing data about pediatric cancers and structural abnormalities
- [Applying layperson synonyms to the Human Phenotype Ontology](https://phenotypr.com/)
- [CD2H](https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/workgroup/people-expertise-attribution/): a collaborative initiative to coordinate informatics efforts across the CTSA program.
  - [LOINC2HPO project](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/loinc2hpoAnnotation): Extracting phenotype information from lab tests in Electronic Health Records (EHRs): 
  - [Architecting Attribution](https://github.com/data2health/architecting_attribution): Creation of a computational representation of contributions
  - [Edu-Harmonization](https://github.com/data2health/edu-harmonization): Educational resource and competency harmonization project
- [N-Lighten](https://alaska.dev.eagle-i.net:8443/): An educational resource discovery tool

### Ontology development
