My research focuses on development and use of semantic technologies to facilitate new knowledge discovery and promote scientific reproducibility. I performs data biocuration, and develop ontologies and data standards for phenotypes, diseases and other biomedical domains with the goal of improving disease diagnostics and health outcomes. Additionally, I participate in educational efforts in data management best practices and data science.

## Current Interests and Projects:

### Biocuration projects
- [Monarch Inititative[(https://monarchinitiative.org/): a system that allows for cross-species disease discovery
- [Applying layperson synonyms to the Human Phenotype Ontology](https://phenotypr.com/)
- Extracting phenotype information from lab tests in Electronic Health Records (EHRs): [LOINC2HPO project](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/loinc2hpoAnnotation)
- N-Lighten
### Ontology development
- Human Phenotype Ontology
- Monarch Merged Disease Ontology (MONDO)
- Uberpheno
- Cell Ontology
- Envioronmental Exposure Ontology
### Education and Teaching
- OHSU Library Data Science Institute
- BD2K Open Educational Resources for Data Science
- BD2K Data Science skills courses
- Ontologies 101
