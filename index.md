_This website is currently under development_

My research focuses on development and use of semantic technologies to facilitate new knowledge discovery and promote scientific reproducibility. I performs data biocuration, and develop ontologies and data standards for phenotypes, diseases and other biomedical domains with the goal of improving disease diagnostics and health outcomes. Additionally, I participate in educational efforts in data management best practices and data science.

## Current Interests and Projects:

### Biocuration projects
- [Monarch Inititative](https://monarchinitiative.org/): a system that allows for cross-species disease discovery
- [Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/): a data resource portal containing data about pediatric cancers and structural abnormalities
- [Applying layperson synonyms to the Human Phenotype Ontology](https://phenotypr.com/)
- Extracting phenotype information from lab tests in Electronic Health Records (EHRs): [LOINC2HPO project](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/loinc2hpoAnnotation)
- [N-Lighten](http://alaska.dev.eagle-i.net/): an educational resource discovery tool

### Ontology development
- [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/)
- [Monarch Merged Disease Ontology (MONDO)](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/mondo.html)
- [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology)
- [Phenotype and Trait Ontology](https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato)
- [Envioronmental Exposure Ontology](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology)

### Education and Teaching
- [OHSU Library Data Science Institute](https://ohsulibrary-datascienceinstitute.github.io/)
- [BD2K Open Educational Resources for Data Science](https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/)
- [BD2K Data Science skills courses](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/research/bd2k.cfm)
- Ontologies 101
